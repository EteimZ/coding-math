# Introduction to trigonometry

Trigonometry is the field of mathemetics that studies right angle triangles and their ratio of lengths.
Every right angle triangle has 3 sides the **Hypothenus**, **Adjacent** and **Opposite**.

## Trigonometric ratios

If the sides of right angle triangle are divided together we get what is called **trig ratios**. 
These ratios are related to the triangle's **angle**. There are three main trig ratios:

- Sine
- Cosine
- Tangent

The Sine is the ratio of the Opposite side to the Hypothenus. The Cosine is the ratio of the Adjacent side to the Hypothenus. The Tangent is the ratio of the Opposite side to the Adjacent side.

## Math Equations

The Sine, Cosine and Tangent are represented by the following equations:

- Sine: $\sin \theta = \frac{ Opposite }{ Hypothenus }$
- Cosine: $\cos \theta = \frac{ Adjacent }{ Hypothenus }$
- Tangent: $\tan \theta = \frac{ Opposite }{ Adjacent }$
